I acknowledge that participating in these events involves inherent risks, and I accept full responsibility for any associated liability and risk. By signing up, I confirm that I am 18 years of age or older.

  By signing up, I agree to allow the City of Cambridge to send me emails related to my chosen drains.

%p
  I understand that as a volunteer, I have control over the dates and times of my work. The City of Cambridge is not responsible for scheduling my volunteer activities or monitoring my compliance with the guidelines. I affirm that I am not receiving any compensation or consideration for my participation, and I have read, understood, and freely and willingly agreed to the release and hold harmless provisions stated below.

%p
  When adopting a storm drain, residents are encouraged to get creative with the names they choose. However, please note that the City reserves the right to review and approve all storm drain names to ensure they are appropriate for public display. Names that are deemed offensive, inappropriate, or do not align with the City's values or Storm Stewards program goals may be subject to change. The City will reach out to residents for an alternative name if needed.

%p
  I agree to release, waive, and forever discharge the City of Cambridge (“the City”) and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts ("the Commonwealth"), as well as their respective employees, departments, officers, and agents, from any and all actions, causes of action, claims, demands, damages, costs, loss of services, expenses and compensation claims or demands arising from accidents, illnesses, injuries, losses, destruction, or property damage directly or indirectly resulting from my participation in this activity.

%p
  I further agree  not to, whether by myself or in concert with others, pursue any judicial proceeding of any kind whatsoever against the City of Cambridge or the Commonwealth or their respective employees, departments, officers, and agents, for any injury, loss, or damage arising from or related to my participation in this activity, regardless of whether it is caused by negligence or otherwise. 

%p
  This Waiver and Release is binding on my spouse, heirs, executors, administrators, assigns, employees, insurers, subrogees and all of my family members. It applies to all losses, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, related to my participation in this activity.

%p
  This Waiver and Release contains the entire agreement between the parties hereto, and the terms of this release are contractual, not a mere recital.
